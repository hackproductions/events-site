# HackNotts 2020: Instructions for guests joining workshops

We'll be using Microsoft Teams for live talks, workshops and ceremonies.

1. When you join the Zoom, make sure to **mute** your microphone.
2. Your microphone will be heard on stream even if your camera is not, while other presenters are live. Make sure you're muted when you're not live. 
3. You will only be seen on stream once our producers have set up your camera. They will communicate with you when you're ready to go!
4. Open Twitch chat [here](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/hackathonsuk/chat)!
5. Feel free to chat with one of the organisers / producers in the call chat.

### Notes

- If you do not want to be on stream, let our producers know and they can remove you!
- Microsoft Teams will say it's broadcasting. This doesn't mean you're live yet. Listen for instructions from our team!
