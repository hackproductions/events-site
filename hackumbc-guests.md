# hackUMBC 2020: Instructions for guests joining workshops

We'll be using Zoom for live talks, workshops and ceremonies.

1. When you join the Zoom, make sure to join **without video**
2. You will be muted upon entry
3. If you want to speak on stream, turn on your camera and unmute your microphone.
4. Feel free to chat with one of the organisers / producers in the Stream chat.

### Notes

- If you do not want to be on stream, turn off your camera and Zoom will hide you
- Zoom will always say it's streaming. This does not mean you're always on the livestream. Listen for instructions from Hack Productions for when you're live
