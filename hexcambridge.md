# Hex Cambridge: Instructions for Live Presenters

We'll be using Hack Productions Connect for putting live presenters on the stream.

1. Head over to [connect.hack.productions](https://connect.hack.productions/?room=hackcambridgebroadcast&hash=90f0) and type in the provided password. You can get this via Hack Productions.
2. Join the link about 10-15 minutes before your workshop
3. Hack Productions will count you down to going live. They will count you down so you know when you're live
4. When you finish, Hack Productions will take you off stream. You'll be able to see this on your screen.

Stream delay is about ~1-3 seconds.

## Twitch Chat

Open the popup Twitch chat [here](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/hackathonsuk/chat). This won't have the video to prevent you getting distracted.

### Notes

- OBS Ninja will allow you to mute yourself and turn off your camera if you want to come off the livestream.
- On your screen, you will be able to see yourself, any other guests as well as the livstream. This is in real time so you will know when you're live.
- When you finish, make it clear by thanking the audience an saying goodbye. This helps our producers take you off the stream.
- When you say goodbye, hold a smile for a few seconds so we can take you off stream. Hack Productions will communicate with you when you're no longer live.
- Hack Productions will be able to talk while you're live. This won't be heard by the audience so try and wear headphones if possible.
