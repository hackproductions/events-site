# Hack Notts 2020: Instructions for Live Presenters

We'll be using a number of applications for live presenters. Below is a rough summary of what scenarios each software will be used in.

1. Microsoft Teams - Small groups.
2. OBS - Custom setup.

Hack Productions will be handling the live stream during the event. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to Will or Jon on Discord, or drop us an email at [help@hackprods.com](mailto:help@hackprods.com)!

## Twitch Chat

Open the popup Twitch chat [here](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/hackathonsuk/chat). This won't have the video to prevent you getting distracted.

## Microsoft Teams

We'll be using Microsoft Teams for most of the live presenters. 

1. Download Microsoft Teams or use it in your web browser.
2. Join the Microsoft Teams link 15-20 minutes before your slot.
3. One of the Hack Productions staff will help get you set up.
4. Hack Productions will communicate with you during your slot via Microsoft Teams.
5. We will count you from 5 in verbally, so try and use headphones with Microsoft Teams if possible.

### Note

- Please make it clear when you're finishing up. Make it clear by saying goodbye and or thanking people for coming as this makes it clear to our producers to take you off the stream.

## OBS

We'll only be using OBS for those who've requested it.

1. Talk with Hack Productions 30 minutes before your slot.
2. You should receive a Streaming URL and Stream Key before the slot. If you do not have one, please contact Hack Productions.
3. When you're ready, press Start Streaming. Only the Hack Productions Producer will see this initially.
4. Open up a real time clock, like [time.is](https://time.is), on your computer.
5. Hack Productions will give you an exact time that you will be live. Wait until the time is displayed on your clock before you start.
6. As soon as we hit the time mentioned, start your talk/workshop.
7. When you finish, Hack Productions will take you off stream and communicate with you in Discord in `#mainstage`.
8. Do not press Stop Streaming until Hack Productions has officially taken you off the livestream.
