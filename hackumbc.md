# hackUMBC 2020: Instructions for Live Presenters

We'll be using Zoom for live talks, workshops and ceremonies.

Instructions for workshop guests can be found [here](./hackumbc/guests).

Stream delay is about ~1-3 seconds.
## Twitch Chat

Open the popup Twitch chat [here](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/hackumbc/chat). This won't have the video to prevent you getting distracted.
