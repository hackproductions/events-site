# WiCHacks: Instructions for Live Presenters

## Zoom

We'll be using Zoom to bring people live on stream.

1. Download Zoom or use it in your browser.
2. Join the Zoom link 5-10 minutes before your slot.
3. Hack Productions will count you down to going live. You will also be able to see a preview of the stream so you will know when you're live.
4. When you finish, Hack Productions will take you off stream and communicate with you in the Zoom chat.

## Twitch Chat

Open the popup Twitch chat [here](https://www.twitch.tv/popout/wichacks/chat). This won't have the video to prevent you getting distracted.

### Notes

- Check you can screenshare in Zoom before your slot.
- Zoom will allow you to mute yourself and turn off your camera if you want to come off the livestream.
- On your screen, you will be able to see yourself, any other guests as well as the livstream. This is in real time so you will know when you're live.
- If your camera is off, you will not appear on the stream.
- When you finish, make it clear by thanking the audience an saying goodbye. This helps our producers take you off the stream.
- When you say goodbye, hold a smile for a few seconds so we can take you off stream. Hack Productions will communicate with you when you're no longer live.
- Hack Productions will be able to talk while you're live. This won't be heard by the audience so try and wear headphones if possible.
