# hackUMBC 2020: Instructions for Live Presenters

We'll be using Zoom for live talks, workshops and ceremonies.

Instructions for workshop guests can be found [here](./guests).

## Zoom

We'll be using Zoom on special request and for large groups.

1. Download Zoom or use it in your browser.
2. Join the Zoom link 15-20 minutes before your slot.
3. Open up a real time clock, like [time.is](https://time.is), on your computer.
4. Hack Productions will give you an exact time that you will be live. Wait until the time is displayed on your clock before you start.
5. As soon as we hit the time mentioned, start your talk/workshop.
6. When you finish, Hack Productions will take you off stream and communicate with you in the Zoom chat.

### Notes

- If you do not want to be on stream, turn off your camera and Zoom will hide you.
- Zoom will always say it's streaming. This does not mean you're always on the livestream. Listen for instructions from Hack Productions for when you're live.
- When you finish, make it clear by thanking the audience an saying goodbye. This helps our producers take you off the stream.
- When you say goodbye, hold a smile for a few seconds so we can take you off stream. Hack Productions will communicate with you when you're no longer live.
