# hackUMBC 2020: Instructions for Live Presenters

We'll be using a number of applications for live presenters. Below is a rough summary of what scenarios each software will be used in.

1. Skype - Individuals / small groups
2. Zoom - Large groups
3. OBS - Custom setup

Hack Productions will be handling the live stream during the event. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to Will or Jon on Discord, or drop us an email at [help@hackprods.com](mailto:help@hackprods.com)!

## Skype

We'll be using Skype for most of the live presenters. 

1. Download Skype or use it in your web browser
2. Join the Skype link 15-20 minutes before your slot
3. One of the Hack Productions staff will help get you set up
4. Hack Productions will communicate with you during your slot via Skype. The livestream will not be able to hear them, only you will
5. We will count you from 5 in verbally, so try and use headphones with Skype if possible

### Note

- Please make it clear when you're finishing up. Make it clear by saying goodbye and or thanking people for coming as this makes it clear to our producers to take you off the stream.

## Zoom

We'll be using Zoom on special request and for large groups.

1. Download Zoom or use it in your browser
2. Join the Zoom link 15-20 minutes before your slot
3. Open up a real time clock, like [time.is](https://time.is), on your computer
4. Hack Productions will give you an exact time that you will be live. Wait until the time is displayed on your clock before you start
5. As soon as we hit the time mentioned, start your talk/workshop
6. When you finish, Hack Productions will take you off stream and communicate with you in the Zoom chat

### Notes

- If you do not want to be on stream, turn off your camera and Zoom will hide you
- Zoom will always say it's streaming. This does not mean you're always on the livestream. Listen for instructions from Hack Productions for when you're live
- When you finish, make it clear by thanking the audience an saying goodbye. This helps our producers take you off the stream
- When you say goodbye, hold a smile for a few seconds so we can take you off stream. Hack Productions will communicate with you when you're no longer live

## OBS

We'll only be using OBS for those who've requested it.

1. Talk with Hack Productions 30 minutes before your slot
2. You should receive a Streaming URL and Stream Key before the slot. If you do not have one, please contact Hack Productions
3. When you're ready, press Start Streaming. Only the Hack Productions Producer will see this initially
4. Open up a real time clock, like [time.is](https://time.is), on your computer
5. Hack Productions will give you an exact time that you will be live. Wait until the time is displayed on your clock before you start
6. As soon as we hit the time mentioned, start your talk/workshop
